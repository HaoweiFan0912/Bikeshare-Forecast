# Bikeshare Ridership Forecast

## Overview

This study uses Bayesian Poisson regression to predict the number of usage of bike-sharing stations at 27 locations on University of Toronto St. George campus for specific years, months, and four-hour intervals of the day.


## File Structure
**ToBeMoreDetail**
The repo is structured as:

-   `data/00-simulated_data` contains the simulated datasets.
-   `data/01-raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto-ridership-data/.
-   `data/02-analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains details about LLM chat interactions, sketches, datasheet.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate data, download data, clean data, test data, fit models, validate models, and exploratory data analysis.


## Statement on LLM usage
**ToBeMoreDetail**
This project involved the guidance of Chat GPT for completing parts of the code, including data simulation, data cleaning, model fitting, and visualization. The complete conversation can be found at the following path: `other/llm_usage`.
